  <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need them for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Para. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
